# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Allan, a Computer Science Student from [University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao](http://usl.edu.ph/). I'm a passionate developer who loves to explore the world of technology. The areas of interest that I want to pursue are data science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and someday, some open-source contributions.

I'm also a digital creator that creates contents about showcasing my projects and some tutorials on how to code.
